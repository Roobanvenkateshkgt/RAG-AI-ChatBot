    "question": "How many pairs of parallel edges, such as AB and GH or EH and FG, does a cube have?",
    "choices": ["6", "12", "18", "24", "36"],
    "answer": "12",
    "solution": "A cube has 12 edges. Each edge has exactly one parallel edge on the opposite face, giving 12 edges forming 6 pairs of parallel edges per orientation. Total pairs: 12."

    "question": "How many subsets of two elements can be removed from the set {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11} so that the mean (average) of the remaining numbers is 6?",
    "choices": ["1", "2", "3", "5", "6"],
    "answer": "3",
    "solution": "Total sum of 1..11 is 66. Remove two numbers x and y such that the mean of remaining 9 numbers is 6: (66 - x - y)/9 = 6 → x + y = 12. The pairs summing to 12 are: (1,11), (2,10), (3,9). Total of 3 pairs."

    "question": "At Euler Middle School, 198 students voted on two issues. 149 voted in favor of the first issue and 119 voted in favor of the second issue. 29 students voted against both issues. How many students voted in favor of both issues?",
    "choices": ["49", "70", "79", "99", "149"],
    "answer": "99",
    "solution": "Use inclusion-exclusion: Students who voted for at least one issue = 198 - 29 = 169. Let x = students who voted for both. Then 149 + 119 - x = 169 → x = 99."

    "question": "Jeremy's father drives him to school in rush hour traffic in 20 minutes. One day there is no traffic, so his father drives 18 mph faster and gets him to school in 12 minutes. How far in miles is it to school?",
    "choices": ["4", "6", "8", "9", "12"],
    "answer": "9",
    "solution": "Let speed in traffic = v mph, distance = d. d/v = 20/60 = 1/3 hr, d/(v+18) = 12/60 = 1/5 hr. Solve: 1/3 v = 1/5(v+18) → 2v = 54 → v = 27 mph. Distance = 9 miles."
